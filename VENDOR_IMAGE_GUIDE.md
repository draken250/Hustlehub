# Vendor Image Guide for HustleHub

## How to Add Images to Your Products

When creating products on HustleHub, you can add high-quality images that will appear in the Featured Products section and throughout the platform.

### Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: At least 400x400 pixels (recommended: 800x800 pixels)
- **File Size**: Under 5MB
- **Quality**: High-quality, clear images that showcase your product

### How to Add Images

1. **Log into your vendor dashboard**
2. **Go to "Add Product"**
3. **Fill in the product details**
4. **In the "Product Image URL" field, enter a publicly accessible image URL**

### Image URL Sources

You can use any of these services to host your product images:

#### 1. Imgur (Recommended)
- Go to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com)
- Upload your image
- Right-click on the uploaded image and select "Copy image address"
- Paste the URL in the image field

#### 2. Google Drive (Public)
- Upload your image to Google Drive
- Right-click on the image → Share → Copy link
- Make sure the link is set to "Anyone with the link can view"
- Use the direct image link

#### 3. Your Own Website/Server
- Upload the image to your website
- Use the direct URL to the image file

### Image Preview Feature

When you enter an image URL in the product creation form:
- ✅ **Green border**: Image loads successfully
- ❌ **Red border**: Invalid image URL
- **Preview**: You'll see a preview of your image below the URL field

### Best Practices

1. **Use high-quality images** that clearly show your product
2. **Use consistent lighting** and backgrounds
3. **Show multiple angles** if needed (you can add multiple images)
4. **Avoid watermarks** or text overlays
5. **Use square or 1:1 aspect ratio** for best display
6. **Test your image URL** before submitting

### Troubleshooting

**Image not showing up?**
- Check that the URL is publicly accessible
- Make sure the URL ends with an image extension (.jpg, .png, .webp)
- Try opening the URL in a new browser tab to verify it works

**Image looks blurry?**
- Use a higher resolution image (at least 800x800 pixels)
- Make sure the image isn't compressed too much

**Getting an error message?**
- Verify the image URL is correct
- Check that the image file exists and is accessible
- Try a different image hosting service
